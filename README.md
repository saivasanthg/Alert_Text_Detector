## Data Gathering
This project's core dataset was built from a combination of a ready-made source and a strategically designed synthetic dataset. The goal was to train a model that could handle the nuances of real-world language, including sarcasm, historical references, and diverse alert categories, which are often sources of misclassification.

The synthetic data was meticulously created across the following categories:

Handling Ambiguity & Sarcasm: Tweets with "negative" keywords that were not actual alerts (e.g., "What a disaster!" in a movie review or sarcastic remarks).

Temporal Context: Tweets mentioning past events that should not be flagged as current alerts (e.g., "The storm last year...").

Comprehensive Alert Categories: A wide range of positive alert tweets covering various scenarios, including:

Natural Disasters

Health Emergencies

Civil & Political Unrest

Infrastructure Failures & Accidents

Crime and Safety Alerts

Financial Emergencies

Varied Tweet Structures: Data was designed to mimic real social media posts, including tweets with and without hashtags, locations, and different points of view (e.g., first-person vs. third-person announcements).

This approach ensured the model was trained on a rich, diverse dataset that directly addressed common NLP challenges, leading to higher accuracy and precision. Following data collection, a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline was applied to clean and prepare the text for the model.
